            <h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
            <p>Human activities largely impact sustainability, evolution, and natural selection, especially in the context of reproduction, speciation, and mutation. Hendry, Gotanda, and Svensson (2017) highlight these influences and the resulting ecological
                and societal consequences. Here's a breakdown:</p>

        <section id="Human_Impact_on_Sustainability" class="main-section">
            <header>Human Impact on Sustainability</header>
            <p>Activities such as <u>deforestation</u>, <u>pollution</u>, <u>urbanization</u>, and <u>overexploitation</u> of natural resources often disrupt ecosystems. Such activities create challenges for the sustainability of biodiversity, affecting
                the survival of species. Destruction of habitat, for instance, leads to loss of species and ecological balance, reducing the capacity of environments to sustain life in the long term.</p>

        <section id="Human_Influence_on_Evolution" class="main-section">
            <header>Human Influence on Evolution</header>
            <p>Humans affect the evolutionary process by altering the environments that organisms live in, forcing species to adapt quickly or face extinction. Evolution is driven by natural selection, which occurs when certain traits increase the ability
                of organisms to survive and reproduce. Human-induced changes such as climate change, pollution, and habitat fragmentation create new selective pressures, shaping evolutionary pathways in various ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Reproduction:</span> Human interventions such as selective breeding, domestication, and artificial environments affect reproductive behaviors and traits. Overfishing or hunting certain parts in animals such as the tusks in elephants
                    or large fish size can reduce genetic diversity and influence which traits become prevalent in future generations.</li>
                <li><span><strong>Speciation:</strong></span> Speciation, which happens to be the formation of new species, can be either hindered or accelerated by human actions. Fragmentation of habitats can isolate populations, potentially leading to allopatric
                    speciation. However, habitat destruction and pollution can also prevent speciation by reducing genetic diversity and adaptive capacities.</li>
                <li><span>Mutation:</span> While mutations occur naturally, human-induced factors like radiation, pollution, and chemicals can increase mutation rates. Some mutations may offer adaptive advantages in new or changed environments, while others
                    might be harmful. Increased mutation rates due to human activities could either accelerate evolution or lead to higher extinction risks for some species.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><code>Example: Genetic mutations in urban species</code></p>

        <section id="Human_Impact_on_Natural_Selection" class="main-section">
            <header>Human Impact on Natural Selection</header>
            <p>Human activity often changes the process of natural selection by introducing new environmental pressures or reducing the number of selective forces in nature. For example, by eliminating predators or changing food availability, humans change
                the traits that are advantageous for survival:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span><strong>Anthropogenic Selective Pressures:</strong></span> These include pollution, urbanization, climate change, and agriculture, all of which create new environments that select for traits different from those that would have been
                    advantageous in a pre-human world. For example, species that can survive in urban settings may have different traits from those in wild environments.</li>
                <li><span><strong>Directed Evolution:</strong></span> Humans directly influence evolution through selective breeding, genetic engineering, and conservation efforts. Artificial selection can lead to faster evolution of traits than natural processes,
                    often prioritizing traits humans find useful or desirable.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="Ecological_and_Societal_Consequences" class="main-section">
            <header>Ecological and Societal Consequences</header>
            <p>Changes in evolutionary processes due to human activities not only impact ecosystems but also have far-reaching societal consequences.<i>For example</i>, the evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria or pesticide-resistant pests can have
                serious health and agricultural implications. Additionally, altered ecosystems might fail to provide essential services such as pollination, water filtration, and climate regulation.</p>
            <p><code>Example: Ecosystem service collapse</code></p>
